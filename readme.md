## Brief Explanation of How the Chatbot Works

The chatbot works by taking a user's natural language query, converting it into a SQL query using OpenAI's GPT-4o llm model, executing the query on a SQL database, and then presenting the results back to the user in natural language. This process involves several steps of data processing and interaction with the OpenAI API and a SQL database, all seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit application.
